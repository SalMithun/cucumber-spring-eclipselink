Cucumber Spring and Eclipselink
===============================

a simple project -- this one makes use of cucumber to drive Spring and Eclipselink writing
persistent data to an HSQL in memory DB

There are 2 entity classes Book and Author. There is a bidirectional many to many relationship between them
 as a Book will have one or more Authors, and an Author may contribute to zero or more Books.

There is a relish project site at https://www.relishapp.com/zrgs-org/cucumber-spring-and-eclipselink/docs

Found the beginnings of this example in the book Cucumber Recipes
